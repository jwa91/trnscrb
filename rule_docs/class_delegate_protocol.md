# Class Delegate Protocol

Delegate protocols should be class-only so they can be weakly referenced

* **Identifier:** `class_delegate_protocol`
* **Enabled by default:** Yes
* **Supports autocorrection:** No
* **Kind:** lint
* **Analyzer rule:** No
* **Minimum Swift compiler version:** 5.0.0
* **Default configuration:**

## Rationale

Delegate protocols are usually `weak` to avoid retain cycles, or bad references to deallocated delegates.

The `weak` operator is only supported for classes, and so this rule enforces that protocols ending in "Delegate" are class based.

For example

```swift
protocol FooDelegate: class {}
```

versus

```swift
↓protocol FooDelegate {}
```

## Non Triggering Examples

```swift
protocol FooDelegate: class {}
```

```swift
protocol FooDelegate: class, BarDelegate {}
```

```swift
protocol Foo {}
```

```swift
class FooDelegate {}
```

```swift
@objc protocol FooDelegate {}
```

```swift
@objc(MyFooDelegate)
 protocol FooDelegate {}
```

```swift
protocol FooDelegate: BarDelegate {}
```

```swift
protocol FooDelegate: AnyObject {}
```

```swift
protocol FooDelegate: AnyObject & Foo {}
```

```swift
protocol FooDelegate: Foo, AnyObject & Foo {}
```

```swift
protocol FooDelegate: Foo & AnyObject & Bar {}
```

```swift
protocol FooDelegate: NSObjectProtocol {}
```

```swift
protocol FooDelegate where Self: BarDelegate {}
```

```swift
protocol FooDelegate where Self: BarDelegate & Bar {}
```

```swift
protocol FooDelegate where Self: Foo & BarDelegate & Bar {}
```

```swift
protocol FooDelegate where Self: AnyObject {}
```

```swift
protocol FooDelegate where Self: NSObjectProtocol {}
```

```swift
protocol FooDelegate: Actor {}
```

## Triggering Examples

```swift
↓protocol FooDelegate {}
```

```swift
↓protocol FooDelegate: Bar {}
```

```swift
↓protocol FooDelegate: Foo & Bar {}
```

```swift
↓protocol FooDelegate where Self: StringProtocol {}
```

```swift
↓protocol FooDelegate where Self: A & B {}
```
